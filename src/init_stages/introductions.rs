// Stage 1

// Welcome to the basics! In this stage, you’ll get familiar with the print function. 
// It’s a simple yet powerful tool to display information. Practice printing text, 
// numbers, or even a mix of both. Experiment and see how the function works.
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 2

// Time to work with numbers! In this stage, you’ll explore integers (whole numbers) and 
// floats (decimal numbers). Practice basic operations like addition and subtraction, and 
// observe how different types of numbers behave. Let’s crunch some numbers!
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 3

// Now let’s dive into booleans, the simplest data type that can only be true or false.
// Booleans are the backbone of decision-making in programming. Practice declaring 
// them, printing them, and combining them using logical operators like and, or, and ! (not).
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 4

// Strings are how we work with text in programming. In this stage, you’ll learn to create, manipulate, 
// and print strings. Practice combining strings and see what kind of text you can put there.
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 5

// Let’s get hands-on with variables! Variables are like labeled boxes that hold data for you to use 
// and manipulate. In this stage, you’ll practice declaring variables, assigning values, and updating
// them. 
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 6

// Time to make decisions! Conditional statements allow your program to execute different code based on 
// specific conditions. In this stage, you’ll practice using if, else if, and else to control the flow
// of your code. Get ready to think logically and handle different scenarios.
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 7

// Loops help you execute a block of code multiple times, making your programs more efficient. In 
// this stage, you’ll explore while loops for repeated actions based on a condition and for loops for
// iterating over ranges or collections. Let’s get looping!
",
    "\
// STILL LEARNING
            
// Stage 8

// Functions are the building blocks of reusable and modular code. In this stage, you’ll learn to
// define your own functions, pass arguments, and return values. Practice breaking tasks into smaller
// chunks using functions to make your code cleaner and more efficient!

// How to create a function
// function <name>(<parameters>)  
//     code here...  
//     return <value `optional`> 
// end  
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING
            
// Stage 9

// Structs let you create custom types to group related data together. They are the core Bite's
// type system, enabling you to model real-world concepts. In this stage, you’ll define 
// structs, initialize them, and access their fields. Time to build your own data structures!

// How to create a struct
// struct <name> {
//     field 1,
//         ...
//     field 255
// }
",
            "\
// Let's wrap it all up! In this challenge, you’ll use what you've learned so far—variables, structs,
// conditionals, functions, and more—but without relying on arrays or collections. Tackle the problem
// step-by-step and demonstrate your Bite expertise!
