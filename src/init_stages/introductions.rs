// Stage 1

// Welcome to the basics! In this stage, you’ll get familiar with the print function. 
// It’s a simple yet powerful tool to display information. Practice printing text, 
// numbers, or even a mix of both. Experiment and see how the function works.
",

// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 2

// Time to work with numbers! In this stage, you’ll explore integers (whole numbers) and 
// floats (decimal numbers). Practice basic operations like addition and subtraction, and 
// observe how different types of numbers behave. Let’s crunch some numbers!
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 3

// Now let’s dive into booleans, the simplest data type that can only be true or false.
// Booleans are the backbone of decision-making in programming. Practice declaring 
// them, printing them, and combining them using logical operators like && (and), || (or), and ! (not).

// Stage 4

// Strings are how we work with text in programming. In this stage, you’ll learn to create, manipulate, 
// and print strings. Practice combining strings, measuring their length, and experimenting with 
// escape characters like \\n for new lines or \\t for tabs. Let’s make text come alive!

        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 5

// Let’s get hands-on with variables! Variables are like labeled boxes that hold data for you to use 
// and manipulate. In this stage, you’ll practice declaring variables, assigning values, and updating
// them. 
",
        "\
// STILL LEARNING

// Stage 6

// Time to make decisions! Conditional statements allow your program to execute different code based on 
// specific conditions. In this stage, you’ll practice using if, else if, and else to control the flow
// of your code. Get ready to think logically and handle different scenarios.
