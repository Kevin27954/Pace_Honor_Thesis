## Default language features - 1-2 weeks
- [ ] Mathematical expressions
- [ ] Type system
- [ ] Variable declarations
- [ ] If statements and expressions
- [ ] Loops
	- [ ] While
	- [ ] For
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Structs - From rust (Objects but smaller)
- [ ] Traits - From rust (Interfaces)
- [ ] Compiler Error messages
- [ ] Garbage Collector

## Custom Implementations -> 1-2 Weeks
- [ ] Ability to rewrite potentially **EVERYTHING** according to the user's syntax, e.g. concept:
> @add (a) and (b) and return sum  
> function add_two_number(a, b) {}
> 
> let sum = @add 4 and 1 and return sum  
> print(sum)
>
> @let (a) be (b)  
> let a = b  
>   
> @let a be b  
- [ ] Maybe Include Rust's "functions might be confused with" syntax so that the compiler can suggest better errors

## Compiler Implementations -> 1 month
- [ ] Gamify something similar to Rustlings, going over the features of programming syntax and features
	    the idea would be a puzzle-like levels where you try to make stuff compile and be correct.
> Stages will have 3 stars (all shown in ASCII art)
> 1 star = Impossible to get i guess  
> 2 star = you used custom syntax  
> 3 star = you used normal syntax?  
- [ ] Gamify the experience of learning the 5 more important data structures
> ASCII art RPG in the terminal experience.
> We have them run little quest helping out villagers and their problems  
> using the correct data structures.
- [ ] Ability to show the viewer line by line what they are executing.
	- [ ] Ability to change the display from normal syntax to "custom syntax" only for a single line.


## Gamify Experience -> Idk give a shitty version if no time, else Mona Lisa version. (1 week) only art.
- [ ] ASCII art representations using ART -> ASCII converter.
> Mona Lisa Verison: More realistic and math intense (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY)  
> Shitty verison: Just normal ASCII shader converter.
