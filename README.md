## Default language features - Expect 1 month
- [x] Mathematical expressions
- [ ] (IP) Variable declarations
- [ ] If statements and expressions
- [ ] Loops
	- [ ] While
	- [ ] For
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Structs - From rust (Objects but smaller)
- [ ] (IP) Error messages
- [ ] Type system
- [ ] Garbage Collector

## Custom Implementations -> Expect 2 Weeks
- [ ] Ability to rewrite potentially **EVERYTHING** according to the user's syntax, e.g. concept:
> @add (a) and (b) and return sum  
> function add_two_number(a, b) {}
> 
> let sum = add_two_number(4, 1)  
> or  
> let sum = @add 4 and 1 and return sum  
> print(sum)
>
> @let (a) be (b)  
> let a = b  
>   
> @let a be b  

## Compiler Implementations -> Expect 1 month
- [ ] Gamify something similar to Rustlings, going over the features of programming syntax and features
	    the idea would be a puzzle-like levels where you try to make stuff compile and be correct.
> Stages will have 3 stars (all shown in ASCII art)
> 1 star = Impossible to get i guess  
> 2 star = you used custom syntax  
> 3 star = you used normal syntax?  
- [ ] Gamify the experience of learning the 3 more important data structures - (Arrays, LinkedList, Trees)
> ASCII art RPG in the terminal experience.
> We have them run little quest helping out villagers and their problems  
> using the correct data structures.
- [ ] ~~Ability to show the viewer line by line what they are executing.~~
	- [ ] ~~Ability to change the display from normal syntax to "custom syntax" only for a single line.~~


## Gamify Experience -> Idk give a shitty version if no time, else Mona Lisa version. (Expect 1 week) only art.
- [ ] ASCII art representations using ART -> ASCII converter.
> Mona Lisa Verison: More realistic and math intense (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg40RWiaHRY)  
> Shitty verison: Just normal ASCII shader converter.


- IP -> In Progress
- WIP -> Work in Progress
